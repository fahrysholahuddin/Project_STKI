Over the course of this project we aim to find the best security measures to put into practice to maintain the intended level of privacy. 
It is safe to say that everybody has a relation to computer security these days.
We believe we will achieve our goal, with an unique angle by enforcing the necessary security measures that are on par with today’s security threats. 
As a byproduct we want our users to have a better understanding of computer security by equipping them with the correct tools.
We do not have the capacity or time to fully support all platforms, operating systems or browsers. 
In that regard the product is a proof-of-concept. 
We will however base our implementation on technology that is highly regarded and considered modern.
